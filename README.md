# Instacart-PYTHON
A data analysis project using PYTHON to analyze data from an an online grocery store, Instacart.

### OBJECTIVE
Instcart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They have good sales historically but want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this analysis is to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 

### DATA
Six datasets that contain all the customer information: orders, oders prior, products, customers and departments

### TOOLS
Language: Python <br />
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy<br />
Software: Jupyter Notebooks and Excel<br />

### KEY SKILLS

- **Data cleaning and preparation:** Checked for and handled duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values.
- **Merging data:**  Selected and prepared data for merging, confirmed merge was successful, and exported final merge as a pkl file.
- **Deriving new variables:** Grouped data by user, order, and department to allow exploration and analysis at each level; used aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.), confirmed the new data created via crosstabs and value counts.
- **Visualizations and report creation:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts and created an Excel report that provided the answers to questions from sales/marketing.

### FOLDERS
The basket analysis was separated into the following folders:
- **Project Management:** Contains the Project Brief
- **Data:** Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. NOTE: This folder has not been included
- **Scripts:** Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
- **Analysis:** Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
-**Sent to client:** Contains the Final Report in Excel
